#Who

Evergreen Community Church is a simple, Reformed congregation serving Powhatan, VA for over 10 years. We are gladly affiliated with the [Presbyterian Church in America](http://pcanet.org), a biblical, Christ-centered denomination with almost 2000 congregations. Our congregation is around 130 strong and growing.  

#Where

Located in central Virginia, Powhatan is a rural bedroom community for Richmond and even DC, over two hours north. We meet at [Flat Rock Elementary School](https://flat-rock-elementary-school.echalksites.com/home_page) at 2210 Batterson Rd Powhatan, VA 23139. Our worship time is 9:30AM, with extensive fellowship following and Branch Groups and study groups meeting throughout the week (link to calendar).
#When

You will learn more about our service to the community, study of God’s Word, and soulful relationships with one another by taking a look at our [calendar.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=egpca316%40gmail.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) We have something for everyone almost every day, but we intentionally leave space for you to have an active family life of your own.  

#Why

For the glory of God, ECC is patiently building a gospel-home for God’s people in Powhatan and surrounding counties. In that home, all will be welcomed, fed and prepared for the adventure of the normal Christian life through a ministry of Word, Sacrament and generous love of our neighbors.
